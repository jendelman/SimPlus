R/SimPlus
================
Jeffrey Endelman

SimPlus was developed for testing
[R/COMA](https://github.com/jendelman/COMA) with
[AlphaSimR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AlphaSimR/index.html),
a package for stochastic simulation of breeding programs.

Financial support has come from the USDA National Institute of Food and
Agriculture (NIFA) Award 2020-51181-32156. [Vignette
1](https://jendelman.github.io/SimPlus/Vignette1.html) illustrates the
basic workflow. For a complete specification of package functions,
consult the [reference
manual.](https://jendelman.github.io/SimPlus/manual.pdf)

To install and load the package:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jendelman/SimPlus", build_vignettes=FALSE)
library(COMA)
```
